== Requirements

. {htmx_link}.
. link:https://nodejs.org[Node] (optional, for development).
. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] (optional, for development).

== Setup

The following _assumes_ you are already using {htmx_link} and have it configured in the same manner as documented in this setup section.

To use via the HTML `script` element, add the following to your layout:

[source,html]
----
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx-select@latest"
        integrity="sha384-sHXxspXI+1G3Mb+k1zPcNdkBRL2Q+nKLcOtkbUPE0USxJFJtjf5pQpuykwTDAcPc"
        crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
----

To use via Import Maps, add the following to your layout:

[source,html]
----
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "htmx-select": "https://unpkg.com/htmx-select@latest"
    }
  }
</script>

<script type="module">
  import * as htmx_remove from "htmx-select";
</script>
----

To install via link:https://www.npmjs.com[NPM], run:

[source,bash]
----
npm install htmx-select
----

Once the library is installed, you only need to require it:

[source,html]
----
<script src="htmx-select.js"></script>
----

== Usage

To use, implement a select element with option values that provide URLs to templates or partials. Example:

[source,html]
----
<!-- index.html -->
<main class="body">
  <label for="version">Version:</label>

  <select id="version"
          name="version"
          class="versions"
          hx-get=""
          hx-trigger="change"
          hx-target=".body"
          hx-ext="select">

    <option value="" class="option">Select...</option>
    <option value="_0.0.0.html" class="option">0.0.0</option>
    <option value="_0.0.1.html" class="option">0.0.1</option>
  </select>
</main>

<!-- _0.0.0_.html -->
<p class="version">
  Version 0.0.0
  <a href="/">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a>
</p>

<!-- _0.0.0_.html -->
<p class="version">
  Version 0.0.0
  <a href="/">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a>
</p>
----

When selecting a specific version (i.e. 0.0.0 or 0.0.1), this extension will make a HTTP GET request based on the `value` of the option selected. This is made possible via both the `hx-get` and `hx-ext` attributes and ensuring each option element has a URI value. That's it!

üí° The `hx-get` attribute should be an empty string. If a string is provided, it'll be overwritten by the value of the selected option.
